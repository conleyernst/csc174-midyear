<!-- Further Notes from the IA -->

<!-- As the IA, I have already ensured that the overall content follows a similar pattern. There is an "About Me" column on each page, giving a brief overview of the student. Next we have Work Experience, and then Extra-Curricular Activities. A grid layout, although it might hamper the readability a little bit, considering the copious amounts of words, it prevents a long scrolly page-->

<!-- Also the IA ensured that all the pictures have a common size and theme. They all have a max height of 250, and more importantly, each Student is wearing African attire, thus tying in with the overall theme and ambience of the website. -->
